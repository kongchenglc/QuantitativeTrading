## üìå Current Features
- **Data Collection**
  - **Historical Stock Price Analysis:**  
    Utilizes the [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/) to fetch Nvidia (NVDA) stock data, while also computing key technical indicators:
    - Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    - Bollinger Bands
  - **Macro-Economic Data:**  
    Leverages the [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) API via the `fredapi` package to obtain:
    - Interest Rates
    - Inflation Rates
    - Unemployment Rates
    - GDP Data
  - **News & Sentiment Analysis:**  
    Scrapes Nvidia-related news from the Google News RSS feed and computes sentiment scores using VADER.

- **Stock Prediction Model (LSTM)**
  - **LSTM-based Stock Price Prediction:**  
    Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict Nvidia's stock closing prices based on historical data.
  - **Features:**
    - Predicts closing prices for the next day.
    - Trains on historical stock data, incorporating sequence-based time series analysis.

## üß† LSTM Stock Prediction Model

The LSTM model is designed to predict the closing prices of Nvidia stock based on historical price data. It uses a sequence-based model where past prices are used to predict future prices.

### Key Components:
- **LSTM Model:**
  - Input: Historical closing prices (last `n_steps` days).
  - Output: Predicted closing price for the next day.
  - The model is built using PyTorch and consists of an LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer.
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - The data is normalized using MinMaxScaler.
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with a rolling window approach for time-series prediction.

### Usage:
1. **Prepare the Data:**  
   The data should be in a DataFrame format containing historical stock prices.
   
2. **Train the Model:**  
   Use the `StockPredictor` class to preprocess the data and train the model.

3. **Backtest and Predict:**  
   After training, perform backtesting on the test set and predict future stock prices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Run the main script to execute all the data collection and stock prediction procedures. The script:
- Collects historical stock data (saved as `data/nvidia_historical_data.csv`)
- Collects macro-economic data (saved as `data/us_macro_data.csv`)
- Collects Nvidia news articles with sentiment scores (saved as `data/nvidia_news_en.csv`)
- Data Cleaning (saved as `data/cleaned_data.csv`)
- Trains the stock prediction model
- Performs backtesting and provides predictions for future stock prices

```bash
python main.py
